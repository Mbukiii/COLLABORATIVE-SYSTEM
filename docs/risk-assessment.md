## Project: Collaborative Task Management Web App
## Date: March 19, 2025
## Version: 1.0

## 1. Introduction

This document identifies potential risks that may impact the successful completion of the Collaborative Task Management Web App project. It provides a systematic approach to assess, prioritize, and develop mitigation strategies for each identified risk.

## 2. Risk Assessment Methodology

Each risk is evaluated based on:
- **Probability**: Likelihood of the risk occurring (1-5, with 5 being highest)
- **Impact**: Potential effect on the project if the risk occurs (1-5, with 5 being highest)
- **Risk Score**: Probability Ã— Impact
- **Priority**: High (15-25), Medium (8-14), Low (1-7)

| R9 | Usability issues affecting user adoption | 3 | 3 | 9 | Medium | User Experience |
| R10 | Challenges with implementing real-time notifications | 3 | 2 | 6 | Low | Technical |
| R11 | Lack of team experience with CI/CD pipelines | 4 | 3 | 12 | Medium | Resource |
| R12 | Compatibility issues across different browsers | 2 | 3 | 6 | Low | Technical |

## 4. Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High Priority Risks

#### R1: Team member unavailability due to competing academic priorities
- **Mitigation Strategy**: 
  - Develop a detailed project schedule that accounts for known academic commitments
  - Implement cross-training so team members can cover for each other
  - Schedule regular check-ins to identify potential availability issues early
  - Create buffer time in the project timeline for unexpected absences
- **Contingency Plan**: Adjust project scope or timeline if necessary

#### R3: Scope creep leading to project delays
- **Mitigation Strategy**: 
  - Clearly define and document project requirements and scope
  - Implement a formal change control process
  - Regularly review project scope during team meetings
  - Prioritize features based on core requirements
- **Contingency Plan**: Implement a minimal viable product (MVP) approach to ensure core functionality is delivered

#### R6: Insufficient testing leading to quality issues
- **Mitigation Strategy**: 
  - Develop comprehensive test plans and test cases
  - Implement automated testing where possible
  - Schedule regular code reviews and pair programming sessions
  - Allocate dedicated time for testing in each sprint
- **Contingency Plan**: Extend testing phase if necessary, potentially reducing scope to maintain quality

### Medium Priority Risks

#### R2: Technical challenges with implementing authentication
- **Mitigation Strategy**: 
  - Research authentication options thoroughly before implementation
  - Consider using well-established libraries or services
  - Allocate extra time for this component in the project schedule
  - Identify team member with prior experience or interest in authentication
- **Contingency Plan**: Simplify authentication approach if necessary

#### R4: Integration issues between frontend and backend systems
- **Mitigation Strategy**: 
  - Define clear API contracts early in the development process
  - Implement continuous integration to catch integration issues early
  - Conduct regular integration testing
  - Document API thoroughly
- **Contingency Plan**: Allocate additional time for integration troubleshooting

#### R5: Deployment environment constraints or limitations
- **Mitigation Strategy**: 
  - Research deployment options early in the project
  - Create a deployment checklist and documentation
  - Test deployment process in a staging environment
  - Consider containerization for consistent environments
- **Contingency Plan**: Have backup deployment options identified

#### R7: Security vulnerabilities in the authentication system
- **Mitigation Strategy**: 
  - Follow security best practices for authentication implementation
  - Conduct security code reviews
  - Implement proper input validation and sanitization
  - Use established security libraries where possible
- **Contingency Plan**: Engage with course instructor or security expert for guidance

#### R9: Usability issues affecting user adoption
- **Mitigation Strategy**: 
  - Conduct early and regular usability testing
  - Follow established UI/UX design patterns
  - Gather feedback from potential users
  - Iterate on UI design based on feedback
- **Contingency Plan**: Prioritize fixing critical usability issues before project completion

#### R11: Lack of team experience with CI/CD pipelines
- **Mitigation Strategy**: 
  - Allocate time for team learning and research
  - Start with simple CI/CD configuration and expand gradually
  - Utilize online tutorials and resources
  - Consider consulting with peers or instructor who have experience
- **Contingency Plan**: Implement manual deployment process as backup

### Low Priority Risks

#### R8: Performance issues with database queries
- **Mitigation Strategy**: 
  - Design efficient database schema
  - Implement indexing where appropriate
  - Monitor query performance during development
  - Conduct performance testing with realistic data volumes
- **Contingency Plan**: Optimize critical queries if performance issues arise

#### R10: Challenges with implementing real-time notifications
- **Mitigation Strategy**: 
  - Research notification implementation options early
  - Consider using established libraries or services
  - Implement polling as a fallback if real-time proves difficult
  - Test notification system thoroughly
- **Contingency Plan**: Implement simpler notification system if necessary

#### R12: Compatibility issues across different browsers
- **Mitigation Strategy**: 
  - Use modern frameworks that handle cross-browser compatibility
  - Define supported browsers early in the project
  - Test regularly across different browsers
  - Follow web standards and avoid browser-specific implementations
- **Contingency Plan**: Focus on ensuring compatibility with the most commonly used browsers

## 5. Risk Monitoring and Control

- **Weekly Risk Review**: Assess current risks and identify new risks during weekly team meetings
- **Risk Owner Assignment**: Assign a team member to monitor and report on each high-priority risk
- **Risk Status Reporting**: Include risk status updates in project status reports
- **Risk Reassessment**: Reevaluate risk probabilities and impacts as the project progresses
